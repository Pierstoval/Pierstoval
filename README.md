Hello 🌘

## I'm a freelance developer, coach and trainer from France

You can see my freelance website there: https://alex-rock.tech/en/, on which there's a specific section to the few [talks](https://alex-rock.tech/en/talks) I spoke at.

I like to write **blog posts** too: https://www.orbitale.io/, sometimes technical, sometimes not purely technical, but I try to often talk about the strange world of tech we work in.

I love free open-source software, and I believe that open-source could help the entire world by bringing community effort into solving peoples problems, could it be by allowing them to create a website for a project in seconds, or create free and open-source plans for [artificial respirators](https://makair.life/).

In any way, when I have a project, I will always try to make it open-source first, create documentation, even if it's just for me, because I hope it will help open-source newcomers to participate too, and give a good example of how things can be done.

I do many things, check out my activities:

* 🐘 **PHP**
  * That's my main skill, been doing PHP since 2008, and tried tons of frameworks.
  * I'm certified Symfony 3 and 4, been doing almost only Symfony-based projects since 2013
  * I made some open-source projects:
    * 🍎[Compotes](https://github.com/Orbitale/Compotes), a small app to visualize analytics about your bank accounts operations.
    * 🪄 [ImageMagickPHP](https://github.com/Orbitale/ImageMagickPHP), an ImageMagick command-line wrapper for PHP.
    * 📄 [CmsBundle](https://github.com/Orbitale/CmsBundle), a very lightweight Page/Category implementation setup for Symfony applications.
    * 🎲 [CharacterManagerBundle](https://github.com/Pierstoval/CharacterManagerBundle), a workflow-like system to create character generators for custom role-playing games.
* 🦀 **Rust**
  * I recently discovered Rust, checkout how I'm using it with [Rymfony](https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony), which is an open-source alternative to the closed-source Symfony CLI binary!
* 🟨 **Javascript**
  * I've experienced jQuery and MooTools in the past, but now I'm willing to work with more professionnal structures.
  * 🍦 I really like vanilla JS, but be sure that I'll also adapt to most frameworks.
  * I know and love **Svelte** and a little **Vue** too.
* 🟦 **Typescript**
  * No specific framework yet, but I'm keen to do something else than vanilla Typescript 😉.
  * My very first "sandbox project" in Typescript is a small Handpan pattern generator you can see there: https://pierstoval.github.io/handpan/ (check the [source code](https://pierstoval.github.io/handpan/index.html)). The Handpan is a musical instrument classified in the _steelpans_, and it has a very zen and lovely sound!
* 🦕 **Deno**
  * I've experienced it, and I'm keen to build cool apps with it!
  * If I ever find the time to do it, I'd like for instance to port Svelte to Deno, I even tried a [proof of concept](https://www.orbitale.io/2020/06/04/an-attempt-to-use-sveltejs-with-deno.html) of using the compiler directly in Deno, and it works, partly, but it works!
