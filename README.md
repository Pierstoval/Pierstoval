Hello 🌘

## I'm a freelance developer, coach and trainer from France

You can see my freelance website there: https://alex-rock.tech/en/, on which there's a specific section to the few [talks](https://alex-rock.tech/en/talks) I gave.

I sometimes write **blog posts** too: https://www.orbitale.io/, sometimes technical, sometimes not purely technical, but I try to often talk about the strange world of tech we work in.

I love free Open Source software, and I believe that Open Source could help the entire world by bringing community effort into solving peoples problems, could it be by allowing them to create a website for a project in seconds, or create free and Open Source plans for [artificial respirators](https://makair.life/).

In any way, when I have a project, I will always try to make it Open Source first, create documentation, even if it's just for me, because I hope it will help Open Source newcomers to participate too, and give a good example of how things can be done.

I do have several activities! Check them out:

* Skills:
  * **🐘 PHP**
    * That's my main skill, been doing PHP since 2008, and tried tons of frameworks in the past.
    * I have two **Symfony** certifications, and been doing a lot Symfony-based projects since 2013
  * **🦀 Rust**
    * I started coding with Rust in 2020, mostly for the purpose of learning, and also for fun.
    * Rust is a low-level language, but I love using it with [♾ Tauri](https://tauri.app) to create **desktop applications**.
  * **🟨 Javascript** and **🟦 Typescript**
    * Even though I'm mostly a backend developer, I also know frontend, at least enough for having been coding on **browsers since 2011**.
    * 🔵 Typescript is definitely the best option nowadays because it's stricter and has more capabilities.
    * I know and love **⭕ Svelte**, and know **✌ Vue** too. (I know React but I don't like it, just saying, because React seems to be kinda famous)
  * **🐳Docker**
    * Been using it to bootstrap projects since 2016, it's a must-have now to make sure a project's development setup is the same for everyone working on it!
  * Other stuff:
    * I'm managing **Debian**/**Ubuntu**-based dedicated servers.
    * I know about OpenAPI, HTTP, REST, GraphQL, and a few things about the protocols that govern make web.
    * Experienced DDD, Clean Architecture, and read a lot about design patterns, programming practices, etc. Nobody can know everything, but I do my best to know as much as I can!

* Open Source projects:
    * [📊 SvelteAdmin](https://github.com/Orbitale/SvelteAdmin) (alpha phase), a Typescript and Svelte-based frontend AdminGenerator, inspired by ReactAdmin and EasyAdmin.
    * [📆 Conventionist](https://github.com/Orbitale/Conventionist) (alpha phase), a Symfony+EasyAdmin application which goal is to ease the creation of convention-like events, with venues management as well as workshops subscriptions, booth and map-based visualisation, etc.
    * [🪄 ImageMagickPHP](https://github.com/Orbitale/ImageMagickPHP), an class-based ImageMagick command-line wrapper for PHP.
    * [🗜 ArrayFixture](https://github.com/Orbitale/ArrayFixture), a small package to simplify static fixtures creation with Doctrine ORM.
    * [🔥 SmokeTesting](https://github.com/Pierstoval/SmokeTesting), a helper tool to ease the creation of Smoke and Functional tests with PHPUnit and Symfony.
    * [🚀 PHP/JS JAMstack template](https://github.com/Pierstoval/php-js-boilerplate), a web-application template based on PHP, Symfony, API Platform, OpenAPI, Svelte Kit, to bootstrap a JAMstack-like project quickly
    * [⏲ processtime](https://github.com/Orbitale/processtime), a cross-platform version of the "time" shell function, but as a binary, which goal is to display execution time for a process.
    * [📈 Svelte vs React benchmarks](https://github.com/Pierstoval/benchmarks-react-svelte-vue), benchmarks of Svelte, SvelteKit, React and Next.js build times and sizes.
    * [📄 CmsBundle](https://github.com/Orbitale/CmsBundle), a very lightweight Page/Category implementation setup for Symfony applications.
* Other side-projects:
    * [🦀 Rymfony](https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony), an open-source Rust-based alternative for the Symfony CLI using Caddy server (currently abandoned, since the Symfony CLI was open-sourced, but it's still some nice work).
    * [🍎 Compotes](https://github.com/Orbitale/Compotes/tree/rewrite), a small desktop app to visualize bank account operations analytics, built with Rust, Tauri, Svelte and Typescript (mostly for my personal usage, but fine too).
    * [🎲 CharacterManagerBundle](https://github.com/Pierstoval/CharacterManagerBundle), a workflow-like system to create character generators for custom table-top role-playing games (usually not very useful, but it contains neat code, I guess).
    * [🌳 Corahn-Rin](https://github.com/Pierstoval/CorahnRin), once a monolithic project created in 2013, but extracted from the monolith as a smaller application in 2021. It is a character and campaign manager for the [Shadows of Esteren](https://portal.esteren.org/en) table-top RPG.
    * [🗺 Esteren Maps](https://github.com/Pierstoval/EsterenMaps), once a monolithic project created in 2013, but extracted from the monolith as a smaller application in 2021. It is a Google-map-like application for the [Shadows of Esteren](https://portal.esteren.org/en) table-top RPG.
* Prototypes (for learning, fun, or anything else):
    * [🎵 Handpan Composer](https://github.com/Pierstoval/handpan-svelte) a fun prototype/experiment to create music for the Handpan, a musical instrument classified in the _steelpans_, with a very zen and lovely sound 🎶.
    * [🦀 Pagoo](https://github.com/Orbitale/pagoo), a prototype/research on creating a daemon-like command executor listening to webhooks via an HTTP API.
    * [♟ Game dev study](https://github.com/Pierstoval/aerg), a prototype of a Svelte+Typescript+Hexcomb boilerplate code for board games development in the browser.
