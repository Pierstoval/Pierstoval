Hello 🌘

## I'm a freelance developer, coach and trainer from France

You can see my freelance website there: https://alex-rock.tech/en/, on which there's a specific section to the few [talks](https://alex-rock.tech/en/talks) I gave.

I like to write **blog posts** too: https://www.orbitale.io/, sometimes technical, sometimes not purely technical, but I try to often talk about the strange world of tech we work in.

I love free Open Source software, and I believe that Open Source could help the entire world by bringing community effort into solving peoples problems, could it be by allowing them to create a website for a project in seconds, or create free and Open Source plans for [artificial respirators](https://makair.life/).

In any way, when I have a project, I will always try to make it Open Source first, create documentation, even if it's just for me, because I hope it will help Open Source newcomers to participate too, and give a good example of how things can be done.

I do have several activities! Check them out:

* **🐘 PHP**
  * That's my main skill, been doing PHP since 2008, and tried tons of frameworks.
  * I have two Symfony certifications, and been doing almost only Symfony-based projects since 2013
  * I made some Open Source projects:
    * [🍎 Compotes](https://github.com/Orbitale/Compotes), a small app to visualize analytics about bank accounts operations.
    * [🪄 ImageMagickPHP](https://github.com/Orbitale/ImageMagickPHP), an ImageMagick command-line wrapper for PHP.
    * [📄 CmsBundle](https://github.com/Orbitale/CmsBundle), a very lightweight Page/Category implementation setup for Symfony applications.
    * [🎲 CharacterManagerBundle](https://github.com/Pierstoval/CharacterManagerBundle), a workflow-like system to create character generators for custom table-top role-playing games.
    * [🌳 Corahn-Rin](https://github.com/Pierstoval/CorahnRin), once a monolithic project created in 2013, but extracted from the monolith as a smaller application in 2021. It is a character and campaign manager for the [Shadows of Esteren](https://portal.esteren.org/en) table-top RPG.
* **🦀 Rust**
  * I started coding with Rust in 2020, mostly for the purpose of learning, and also for fun
  * Here are some of my projects using it:
    * [Rymfony](https://github.com/Orbitale/Rymfony), Open Source alternative to the closed-source Symfony CLI binary
    * [🍎 Compotes v2](https://github.com/Orbitale/Compotes/tree/rewrite), a complete rewrite of the first PHP/Symfony version, using Tauri (a Rust tool to create desktop applications) and the frontend framework Svelte (using Typescript)
* **🟨 Javascript** and **🟦 Typescript**
  * Even though I'm mostly a backend developer, I also know a bit of frontend, at least enough for having been coding on browsers since 2012.
  * 🍦 I really like vanilla JS, because it's light, but 🔵 Typescript is definitely the best option nowadays because it's stricter and has more capabilities.
  * I know and love **Svelte** and a little **Vue** too.
  * Some of my projects are using it:
    * [🍎 Compotes v2](https://github.com/Orbitale/Compotes/tree/rewrite), because even though the backend is using Rust, the frontend is built using Svelte and Typescript.
    * [🎵 Handpan Composer](https://github.com/Pierstoval/handpan-svelte) a fun experiment to create music for the Handpan, a musical instrument classified in the _steelpans_, with a very zen and lovely sound 🎶.
* 🦕 **Deno**
  * Experienced it, tested it to create bundled versions of Typescript projects, but can also be used to compile executables!
  * Soon, most of my Svelte-based projects will be based on Deno rather than Node.js, because I think it's a much better runtime.
